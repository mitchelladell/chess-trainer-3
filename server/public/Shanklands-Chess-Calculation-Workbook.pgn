{ Welcome to Shankland's Chess Calculation Workbook! This is now my 8th course on Chessable, after publishing an entire opening repertoire based on d4 for White, the Semi-Slav for Black against d4, and the Classical Sicilian and/or Berlin against e4. I really enjoyed the work I did with Chessable and wanted to do more, but it seemed like every single reputable opening had been covered. So, I decided to move on to the middlegame.I have had a seemingly infinite number of people come to me over the course of my career and ask how I have been able to improve as much as I did and reach the world elite. I have been constantly labeled as untalented and unpromising, going all the way back to my junior days.Indeed, I never won any youth championships until I was 17. I barely managed to be the fourth strongest junior in the US, lagging well behind Robert Hess, Ray Robson, and Alex Lenderman. At the time, I found it frustrating to be viewed as less promising, but now, I proudly wear that badge with honor.Ratings don't lie, and I think my perceived, and probably real, lack of talent compared to my peers speaks volumes about my work ethic, and about the effectiveness of the training I have done throughout my professional career. The best decision I ever made as a chess player was hiring my coach, Jacob Aagaard.His M.O. is not too complicated; he drills his students with calculation problems, over and over and over again. I have never known anyone to be able to come up with exercises as fast or efficiently as he does, and they are always great training.I believe he is far and away the best living trainer on the planet, and I have been putting my money where my mouth is for the last 9 years. My work with him took me from a struggling barely 2600 to 2700+ and beyond.For Shankland's Chess Calculation Workbook, I had Jacob provide me with 300 positions to solve. I did not choose a single position that went into this course! I just did my normal training and solved all of the exercises to the best of my ability.The process took me a little over a month, and that's for a full-time pro player who calculates well and solves fast! For many, I suspect this could easily be a year's worth of calculation training. I certainly failed a fair share of them.I am not perfect, Magnus is not perfect, and nobody ever will be. But, constant work on exercises like these is what turns you into a better calculator, and by extension, a stronger chess player.The puzzles are broken into 6 sections of 50 puzzles each. I found sections 1 and 3 the easiest, and 4 and 6 the hardest.While they cover different kinds of positions, the general feel is the same- you try to solve the problem to the best of your ability. There is a wide range of difficulties within the course.I always prefer to train on a physical board to mimic the feel of a tournament game as much as possible. There were some positions that I took one look at and decided I will not waste my time by setting it up, because it is too easy.Others left me completely flabbergasted, even upon seeing the solution. Most were somewhere in between.Throughout the course, I made sure to include some key lines I saw, and I showed my incorrect solution on every single problem I got wrong. I have explained the solutions to the best of my ability in the text as well as in the video add-on.Speaking totally honestly, I don't feel like I am training people in this course. I feel as though I am doing my normal training, and everyone else is welcome to come along for the ride.In the past, my students have said they really like this kind of dynamic, and I sincerely hope this calculation work proves useful for all the course followers to become better chess players! Before we get started, I'd like to share a game of mine from 2013 where I calculated poorly. I was already around 2600, but still seriously lacking in a lot of ways.This was one of the games that inspired me to write to Jacob in the first place, and I wrote some notes explaining how I miscalculated. I have not changed anything.This is, word for word, exactly what I wrote 9 years ago. }

{ In part 1, we are going to look at positions that fall into the category of strict tactics. The first few are very easy and meant to be a warm-up, but rest assured, they get tougher very fast! Just like all of the other sections, every single one of these puzzles was given to me by Jacob to solve.I made sure to explain what I was thinking in each position, as well as how this measures up to the intended solution. While some of them seem like they should not be too hard, most of the time, the player playing the game got it wrong, and we will see games from some pretty good players here! Your goal for this section should be to be as accurate as possible.I don't imagine anyone would get 50/50. I certainly didn't! But a big part of becoming a better calculator is getting the easy positions right 90% of the time instead of 80%. This will make you better at punishing mistakes, and less prone to blunders of your own. There are some key tenets of calculation that will be on display a lot throughout the course, though maybe especially in this section.I would recommend trying to work them into your thought process. They are:1. Always examine all checks and captures2. If there is a move that you really want to make, and your opponent is stopping you from making it, the first question you should always ask is 'What happens if I do it anyway?'3. Be very wary of automatic moves that are not 100% forced.4. Always try to stretch your mind to consider candidate moves that you missed the first time around.Oftentimes, that is all that is needed to solve a position if the resulting variations are not too complex. Additionally, Jacob's 3 questions will often help you if you are stuck. They are:1. What is my worst placed piece?2. Where are the weaknesses?3. What is my opponent's idea?Happy solving! }

41. Rh7+
{ We had just seen a case of examining all checks and captures, and here we see another one.  This move looks wrong because Black's queen can take the rook, but when thinking of two key tenets of calculation, it makes perfect sense. First, obviously, examine all checks and captures.Second, Rh7+ is clearly the move White really would like to make, but it seems like he can't because the rook is hanging. But what happens if I do it anyway? Black resigned rather than face the music.Let's see how the game would have ended had she continued the game.   41.e6  Black is threatening a perpetual check directly, and any move that is not a check will allow the threat to be executed. As such, e6 is too slow.  41...Qb3+  42.Kb1  Qd3+=  White is unable to escape the checks. }

This clever check wins a rook as Black is unable to take the knight.   47.Qe3?  White is a rook down and has no time for such slow moves. Black is now winning every which way, but I quite like the one he chose in the game for its simplicity.  47...Rc2!  Totally idiot proof. Black's only issue is that his king is a little open, and giving up his extra rook to transpose to an endgame up a zillion pawns is a perfectly good way to bring in the full point.  48.Rxe6  Rxg2+  49.Kh1  Rd1+  50.Qe1  Rxe1+  51.Rxe1  Rg3-+  Bluebaum won easily. }

{ Welcome to Chapter 2. These 50 positions are all based on the concept of Candidate Moves. When we first learn to play chess, every legal move is a candidate move.As we improve, the list of candidate moves rapidly shrinks as our understanding allows us to dismiss most possibilities as poor with a quick glance. While it is always good to develop a better understanding and intuition, relying too much on this skill will lead you to missing important candidates.Most of these problems have one difficult move to see because it looks wrong or is not intuitive, but once you see it, the rest tends to be pretty easy. This is important in broadening your mind, in particular for players like me who are far from creative geniuses! I thought this was one of the easier chapters, but I certainly did not get 100% right. Let’s get to solving! }

{ Off we go to the penultimate chapter! This one is all about defense. The chapter was designed to be hard, but I found the positions were a bit easier than in chapters 4 or 6. In general, I’m pretty comfortable defending: anyone who successfully plays the Sicilian for a long time should be pretty comfortable containing activity and keeping attacks at bay.That said, it is still a tough chapter in general, and I certainly got some wrong. There were a couple positions I thought were impossible, and Jacob chided me that I was just inept! But how does the saying go? Just because you are right does not mean the other person is wrong? Perhaps we are both right. }

{ To finish off the course, I’d like to show two games that I have played recently. I am not a perfect calculator now, I never will be. But, I do think the improvement we see when comparing where I am now to where I was 9 years ago shows a staggering difference, and I think this has been the biggest reason for my jump into the 2700s and beyond. }
